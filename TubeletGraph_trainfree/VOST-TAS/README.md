# VOST-TAS Dataset
![VOST-TAS Examples](../assets/vost-tas.jpg)
**VOST-TAS (TrackAnyState)** is an extended version of the VOST validation set with explicit transformation annotations for tracking and understanding object state changes in videos.

## Overview
VOST-TAS enables evaluation of video understanding systems on their ability to track objects through physical transformations and describe resulting state changes. The dataset contains:
- **57 video instances**
- **108 transformations**
- **293 annotated resulting objects**

Each video sequence is annotated with temporal segments corresponding to object state transformations, including action descriptions and segmentation masks for resulting objects.

## Annotations and Visualizations
VOST-TAS annotations are found in [vost_tas.json](vost_tas.json) and you can explore the dataset interactively using [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb)!
- Note: [VOST](https://www.vostdataset.org/) dataset needs to be first downloaded and `data_dir = '<DATA>/VOST'` in the notebook needs to be updated.
```bash
jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
```

## Dataset Details
Please refer to the Appendix of the [manuscript](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04678) for more details regarding dataset construction and evaluation metrics.

## Evaluation
Please refer to [here](https://github.com/YihongSun/TubeletGraph?tab=readme-ov-file#vost) for the instructions of evaluating state-graph in terms of temporal localization, semantic correctness, spatiotemporal recall, and over transformation recall.
